## Big2 Frontend
Big two (also known as deuces, capsa, pusoy dos, dai di and various other names) is a card game of Chinese origin. It is similar to the games of winner, daifug≈ç, president, crazy eights, cheat, and other shedding games. The game is very popular in East Asia, and in Southeast Asia (due to overseas Chinese influence), especially throughout mainland China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Macau, Taiwan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore. It is played both casually and as a gambling game. It is usually played with two to four players, the entire deck being dealt out in either case (or sometimes with only 13 cards per player, if there are fewer than four players). The objective of the game is to be the first to play of all of one's cards.
